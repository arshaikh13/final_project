                <li class="tand">
                    One of the main characters in the show. This is the individual who lost his family and is now on a journey to slay the demons who caused him so much harm. Although he is very weak in the beginning, he works with many other slayers to perfect his skills. His strengths are water breathing, strong resolve, great intellect, and tendency to learn quickly.

                <li class="nezd">
                    Another main character within this anime. Her name is Nezuko and she is the sister of Tanjiro as well as the sole survivor of the family massacare. However, her escape came with a price. She has developed a rare condition where she becomes half demon. Join her as she and her brother try to reverse these effects. Her strengths include quick speed, inhuman agility, fire techniques, and sharp claws.

            </div>
            <li class="inod">
                Also part of the main character crew, Inosuke prides himself over his brawn rather than brains. He is a quick-tempered individual who is always ready for a fight. His arch nemesis is a powerful demon who had slaughtered his mother when he was only an infant. Which is why he chooses to follow the path of the demon slayers in order to exact revenge. Although he may seem silly at first glance, he is always willing to lay down his life for the things he holds most dear.

            <li class="zend">
                    This character is quite interesting. Over the course of the show, you will likely develop new feelings for this individual. Appearing as a low-level slayer, Zenitsu has a hidden talent for lighting breath. Yet to unlock this, he must overcome his fears of fighting and facing the enemy. Much like inosuke, he often unlocks this massive power when the things he holds dear are being threatened. And in his case, would be his love for Nezuko.

        <li class="giyud">
            A demon slayers journey consists of many struggles as well as triumphs. And at the highest level, you are given many awards and titles. One such title is the rank of Hashira. One who is an extremly powerful demon slayer capable of defeating some of the most powerful demons. In this case, Giyu is a quite calm individual. He is rarely seen without a straight expression on his face. Seeming emotionless, Giyu actually has an open mind and has low respect for those who throw away their lives. Which is probably why he offers help occasionally to the team of 3.

                    This is Muzan. The main antagonist of the show. He is the Demon King and the same individual who started this outbreak of demons. Born from his search for a cure to his ilness, he is able to control any demons that hold his blood. Thus, he was the one who may have played a hand in the murder of Tanjiro's family. He is quite powerful as he is ranked number one amongst the demons. Tune into the show to see how his battle will end against Tanjiro and the other slayers.
